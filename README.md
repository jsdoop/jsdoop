### EXAMPLE OF EXECUTION JSDoop 1.0 on localhost
#### Deploy rabbitmq server on Docker
- docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 -p 5673:5673 -p 15674:15674 rabbitmq:3

#### Enable plugins on rabbitmq server
- docker exec -it some-rabbit //bin//bash
- rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
- rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_stomp
- rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_web_stomp
- rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_web_stomp # Optional
- rabbitmqctl stop_app
- rabbitmqctl reset    # Be sure you really want to do this! It removes all saved data on rabbitmq server
- rabbitmqctl start_app

#### Clone JSDoop 1.0
- git clone --branch "1.0-(old-version)" https://github.com/jsdoop/jsdoop.git
- cd jsdoop
- cd scripts
- sh yarn_dev.sh 

#### Terminal 1 - DATA SERVER (Redis)
- cd jsdoop/examples/lstm-text-generation/data-server
- node data_server.js

#### Terminal 2 - Monitor
- cd jsdoop/examples/lstm-text-generation/lstm-monitor-app
- node start_monitor.js 5000 10 # 5000 is number of maps you want to perform. 10 is every how many maps you want to make a reduce.

#### Terminal 3 - Deploy web server
- cd jsdoop/examples/lstm-text-generation/lstm-worker-app
- npm run worker

#### Open browser - Each browser is a new worker. It was tested using Google Chrome.
- http://localhost:1234

#### Use http://localhost:15672/#/queues for checking the correct performance of the system (Rabbitmq queue server).
