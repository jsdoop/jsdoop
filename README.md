# JSDoop 2.0
JSDoop Library 2.0 - Distributed Object-Oriented Platform on the Browser.

JSDoop version 2.0 has been redesigned and reimplemented from scratch. This version allows performing federated learning using volunteer edge devices. 

Developed by José Ángel Morell. 
For more information please check this repository https://github.com/jsdoop/jsdoop

## Getting started
This repository is a new version of the JSDoop library. Now the library is divided into three submodules:
- JSDoop-py
- JSDoop-stats-server
- JSDoop-server

### EXAMPLE OF EXECUTION JSDoop 1.0 (deprecated) ON LOCALHOST

### EXAMPLE OF EXECUTION JSDoop 2.0 ON LOCALHOST
#### TERMINAL 1
- git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jsdoop/jsdoop.git
- cd jsdoop
- cd jsdoop-stats-server
- docker-compose up

#### TERMINAL 2
- cd jsdoop
- cd jsdoop-server
- docker-compose up

#### TERMINAL 3
- python3 -m venv jsdoopenv
- source ./jsdoopenv/bin/activate
- cd jsdoop
- cd jdsoop-py
- pip install -r requirements.txt 
- cd src
- cd constants
- Edit constants.py with your favourite editor (e.g., vi, nano, ...). Choose host and port. For instance: JOB_HOST_REMOTE = "http://localhost" JOB_PORT_REMOTE = 5500
- Edit jobs.py and use the same values than above. For instance: REMOTEHOST = "http://localhost" REMOTEPORT = 5500 
- cd ..
- cd scripts
- sh create_topology.sh
- sh init_dataset_mnist.sh
- sh new_job.sh # Copy the ID of the job (last number printed in terminal)
- sh aggregator.sh 1645131584358 # 1645131584358 is the ID of the job

#### TERMINAL 4
- source ./jsdoopenv/bin/activate
- cd jsdoop
- cd jdsoop-py
- cd scripts
- sh worker.sh 1645131584358 theusername 1 # 1 is a seed for reproducibility (you can use any number).


#### Use http://localhost:15672/#/queues for checking the correct performance of the system (Rabbitmq queue server).
- USER: guest
- PASSWORD: guest
- https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html

#### Use http://localhost:61112/index.php for analyzing statistics (PHPMyAdmin - MySQL database):
- USER: root
- PASSWORD: password


Don't forget that we use REDIS to store intermediate results. Intermediate results are deleted during execution. However, when you finish working with a job, you need to delete these intermediate results to clear your RAM. To do this, you need to run: "sh delete_job.sh 1645131584358" where 1645131584358 is the job ID.

Please, be careful when running JSDoop 2.0 locally because when you use many workers they can be much faster than the aggregator (i.e. all calculations are stored and executed in the RAM memory). To work around this, you can increment local steps before aggregation (edit jsdoop-py/src/constants/jobs.py local_steps = 300 or more). Also, if you want to run everything on the same machine, I recommend at least 16 GB of RAM or more.

You can use an API REST to check that everything is stored correctly. For instance:
http://localhost:8081/get_job?id_job=1645131584358


Later I will add how to use a worker from a browser.
